# **Brief**

In this project, we're creating a Dynamic Table with Pagination.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

# **Users should be able to:**

- Display 10 entries of data preloaded into **app.js**
- Sort columns ascending or descending by ID, Name, Email Address, and Job Title
- When sorting ascending the top arrow in the table header will be a darker blue and the bottom arrow will be a lighter blue. You can update the style by adding a class of `ascending` to the `button`. See line 22 in the index.html starter file as an example.
- When sorting descending the bottom arrow in the table header will be a dark blue and the top arrow will be a lighter blue. You can update the style by adding a class of `descending` to the `button`.
- Users can view the next page of data (if you’re not on the last page already) by clicking on the next arrow (bottom right).
- Users can view the previous page of data (if you’re not on the first page) by clicking on the previous arrow (bottom right).

# **Getting Started**

1. To get started, [download the zip file](https://store.selfteach.me/products/home). This includes all the project assets you need to get started: Figma file, images, and a style guide.
2. Take a look around. Look at the project's Figma file. This is a great way to see how the pieces and parts should look within the browser.
3. Open the project's `README.md` file. It has additional information on how the project is structured.
4. Customize your project/file architecture to your liking.
5. Happy coding!
6. Once you're finished, share your work using **#adventofcss**

# **Taking your Project to the Next Level**

- Use a framework or libraries like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), or [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla CSS.
- Hide the toaster pop-up by clicking on the close button. (_HINT: This can be accomplished in CSS with a checkbox._)
- Try adding interactivity by participating in the Advent of JavaScript
