# Brief

In this project, we're creating a Password Generator.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

# Users should be able to:

- The text input field should automatically update as the range field changes or one of the items is checked
- The user can click on the copy icon to the right of the input field to copy the password to their clipboard.
- When a user clicks on the copy icon, a class of "copied" should be added to the button. This will display the word "Copied" and change the text color to green.
- After 5 seconds, the "copied" class should be removed from the button.
- The range slider should allow the user to change the password length. The minimum amount is 6 and the max is 32 (limits are imposed through the HTML element)
- Checking symbols will allow symbols to be used in the password
- Checking numbers will allow numbers to be used in the password
- Checking lowercase letters will allow lowercase letters to be used in the password
- Checking uppercase letters will allow uppercase letters to be used in the password
- Checking exclude similar letters will remove similar letters from the password (i, l, 1, L, o, 0, O)

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework or libraries like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), or [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla CSS.
- Style a mobile version of the site where the sidebar appears on top of the content area
