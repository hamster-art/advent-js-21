3. Open the project's README.md file. It has additional information on how the project is structured.
4. Customize your project/file architecture to your liking.
5. Happy coding!
6. Once you're finished, share your work using #adventofcss

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Use a framework or libraries like Tailwind CSS, Styled Components, or CSS Modules. Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla CSS.
- Animate the text values in.
